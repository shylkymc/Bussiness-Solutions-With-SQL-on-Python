# Bussiness Solutions With SQL on Python

In this project, I analyzed music markets' situation. I used SQL queries with python. I managed a relational database. I observed database and I detected relationships. I used joins to obtain observable tables. I niggled on genres, sales, employee performances. I visualized results by using matplotlib.
