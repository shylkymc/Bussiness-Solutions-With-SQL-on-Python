# Business Solutions with SQL on Python

In this project, I analyzed the music market's situation. I used SQL queries with Python. I managed a relational database, observed a database, and detected relationships. I used joins to obtain observable tables. I focused on genres, sales, and employee performances. I visualized results by using Matplotlib. 

## Conclusion
USA has a high customer market. Especially, there is an interest in the "Rock" genre. 

I can claim that there is customer potential in Czech Republic. The proportion of those interested in the "Rock" genre is 51%. It is an important point to evaluate.
